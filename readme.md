Seed for Test Driven Development with Typescript 2 (https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) using RxJS (https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) Observable.
Mocha and Chai are used for testing.
Imported from https://github.com/laszlokiraly/typescript-tdd
Took me 15mn to find it, grab it and make it work

Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/guillaumeagile/codingtest-ts-digikare
cd typescript-tdd
npm install
```

Run:
```
npm test
```

This would watch source and test files for changes and execute the tests.
