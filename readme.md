Seed for Test Driven Development with Typescript 2 (https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) using RxJS (https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) Observable.
Mocha and Chai are used for testing.
Imported from https://github.com/laszlokiraly/typescript-tdd
Took me 15mn to find it, grab it and make it work

Installation:
it's recommended to install TypeScript globally:
```
npm i typescript -g
```
and then other necessary librairies
```
npm i chai -D
npm i mocha -D
npm i @types/chai -D
npm i @types/mocha -D
npm i ts-mocha -D
npm i typescript -D
```

Run:
```
npm run build
npm run test
```

This would watch source and test files for changes and execute the tests.
